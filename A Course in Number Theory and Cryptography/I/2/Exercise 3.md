## Part A

For any divisor $a \ne \sqrt n$, we have $a < \sqrt n$ or $a > \sqrt n$. We examine the case where $a < \sqrt n$. Given $a$ is a divisor of $n$, there exist an integer $b$ such that $ab = n$. Note this expression also shows $b$ is a divisor of $n$. Also notice

$$
\begin{align}
a &< \sqrt n \\
ab &< \sqrt n b \\
n &< \sqrt n b \\
n^2 &< n b^2 \\
n &< b^2 \\
\sqrt n &< b.
\end{align}
$$

We simply map $a$ to $b$ for our one-to-one correspondence. Given our choice was arbitrary, we may assert for every $n$ divisor $a < \sqrt n$, there exist an $n$ divisor $b > \sqrt n$. A similar argument can show that for every divisor $a > \sqrt n$, there exist a divisor $b < \sqrt n$.
