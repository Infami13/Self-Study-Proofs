# Exercise 1

$$
\begin{align}
(212)_3 \cdot (122)_3 &= (2 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3 + 2) \cdot (1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2) \\
                      &= (2 \cdot 3^4 + 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2) + (4 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 4 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 4) \\
                      &= 2 \cdot 3^4 + 5 \cdot 3^3 + 8 \cdot 3^2 + 6 \cdot 3 + 4 \\
                      &= 2 \cdot 3^4 + (3 + 2) \cdot 3^3 + (2 \cdot 3 + 2) \cdot 3^2 + (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 3 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= 2 \cdot 3^4 + 3^4 + 2 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= 3 \cdot 3^4 + 4 \cdot 3^3 + 4 \cdot 3^2 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= 3^5 + (3 + 1) \cdot 3^3 + (3 + 1) \cdot 3^2 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= 3^5 + 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= 3^5 + 3^4 + 2 \cdot 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 \\
                      &= (112111)_3

# Exercise 5
Take $e = 2.7182818\cdots $. For the left side of the decimal, we simply have $(10)_2$. For the right side, notice that $\lfloor 0.7182818 * 2 ^ {15} \rfloor = 23536$. That is, $23536 * 2^{-15} \approx 0.7182818$. Given $23536 = (101101111110000)_2$, we then have

$$23536 * 2 ^{-15} = (101101111110000 * 10^{-15})_2 = (0.101101111110000)_2.$$

All together, $e = 10.101101111110000$.

For base $26$, using $A-Z$ to represent $0-25$, we have $2 = (C)_{26}$. Additionally, $\lfloor 0.7182818 * 26^{3} \rfloor = 12624$, which means

$$12624 * 26 ^{-3} = (SRO * 10^{-3})_{26} = (A.SRO) _ {26}$$

We then see that $e = (C.SRO)_{26}$.

# Exercise 12

From multiplying a $r \times n$-matrix by an $n \times s$-matrix, we know our result will be an $r \times s$-matrix. That is, the resulting matrix will have a total of $rs$ entries. Furthermore, each resulting entry will consist of $n$ multiplications and $n-1$ additions. The numbers being multiplied are bounded by $m$ and the numbers being added are bounded by $m^2$.

Let $m$ be a $k$-bit integer and $n$ be an $l$-bit integer. At worse case, we perform $k^2$ bit operations for the $n$ multiplications for each of the $rs$ entriesâ€”a total of $rsnk^2$ bit operations just for multiplication. Of course, the product of two $k$-bit will be, at most, $2k$-bit.

To account for addition, we are adding $2k$-bit integers together $n-1$ times, which means we will need to eventually add a $2k$-bit integer
